# Raft consensus algorithm in Go

### Purpose
This is a personal learning exercise. I'm attempting to create a working implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm. This will most likely start out as a rather naive implementation and will hopefully increase in sophistication as it progresses.

This is to be used for learning purposes only and should not be used outside of this context.
