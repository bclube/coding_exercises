1,498 bricks

10x10x375 array
of two bytes each

vertical slices are of 375 are close to each other
- better vertical scanning?
- or is it better to do layer by layer?

settle bricks:
sort bricks by their min z coord, ascending
move each brick down until it can't move any more

count disintegratable bricks:
scan top to bottom
if a brick has only one supporting brick, flag it as undeletable
at the end, count up all bricks that have not been flagged

a,b,c   nil    b, c


   a      {b,x}
  xxxxxx  {b}
  y z m   {b,c} {b,c} {b}
ccccc m   {b} {b}
  bbbbb   {}

support chain will be intersection of all support chains
if supported by only a single block, add supporting block to your chain
