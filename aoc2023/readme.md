# Purpose
This is a personal coding exercise. This code is not meant to be used for any purpose outside of this context.

Problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Constraints
I will be using the Go programming language to solve the problems, where coding is required. I will also be using GitHub Copilot to assist in coming up with the solutions, but I'm unsure to what extent. This is a learning exercise, after all, and learning to use AI effectively is an absolutely valid goal in this context. If I learn Go faster because of the AI; or the AI introduces me to a new concept or algorithm for solving a problem, then: yay! If learning is good, then learning to learn more effectively is better, in my book.
